# Rust Fundamentals

## Overview

This comprehensive guide will take you through a journey of mastering Rust,
covering a broad spectrum of topics from the basics to advanced concepts, including design patterns, various data
structures, and algorithms. The content is organized into levels, providing a structured learning path.
