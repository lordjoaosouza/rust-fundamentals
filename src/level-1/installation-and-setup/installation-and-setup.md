# Installation and Setup

## Overview

This chapter will cover the installation and setup of **Rust** on your machine. We will also cover the basics of the
toolchain, including the compiler ([**Cargo**](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/cargo/)), and the standard library.

## Installation

We recommend installing with [**asdf**](https://asdf-vm.com) to manage multiple versions of **Rust** (also other
languages and
tools) on your machine, but you can also install **Rust** with [**rustup**](https://rustup.rs), which is the official
installation method.

### Installing with asdf [Linux (includes WSL) and macOS]

You can see the full instructions to install **Rust** with **asdf** [here](installation-methods/asdf.md).

### Installing with rustup (official Rust method)

You can see the full instructions to install **Rust** with **rustup** [here](installation-methods/rustup.md).
