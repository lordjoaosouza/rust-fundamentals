# Installation and Setup

## Overview

This chapter will cover the installation and setup of Rust on your machine. We will also cover the basics of the Rust
toolchain, including the Rust compiler, Cargo, and the Rust standard library.

## Installation

We recommend installing with [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com) to manage multiple versions of Rust (also other languages and
tools) on your machine, but you can also install Rust with [rustup](https://rustup.rs) or with your system's package
manager.

### Installing with asdf (Linux and macOS only)

You can see the full instructions to install Rust with asdf [here](installation-methods/asdf.md).
